\section{Using AI benchmarks to tune performance}
\label{sec:tune}

Case studies in benchmarking in the enterprise or in HPC Centers

\TODO{For NVIDIA, itâ€™s usually NVML As a equivalent of
AMD OmniStat VAMPIR tools for tensorflow and
pytorch and co that monitor performance at runtime:
tensorboard torchinfo pytorch profiler mlflow}

\TODO{THis section ought to describe how benchmarks help and support Democratization and carpentry or wher oppertunities are to improve them in regards to perfomance tuning.}
